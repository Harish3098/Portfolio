            <h3>1. Stellar Galaxy Classification Model using CNN</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Developed a deep learning model to classify stellar objects, specifically stars and galaxies, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project was initiated as part of a collaborative effort with Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), utilizing image cutouts obtained from their in-house 1.3m telescope.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV</p>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> The project involved preprocessing and augmenting a dataset of 64x64 pixel images of stars and galaxies. The CNN model was trained to distinguish between these classes with high accuracy. Advanced techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation were implemented to optimize the model's performance. The final model demonstrated robust accuracy and was able to generalize well on unseen data.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset, making it a reliable tool for astronomical object classification. This work contributes to the field of astrophysics by aiding in the automated classification of celestial bodies.</p>
